# Course 02242 - Examples

This repository contains a lot of different examples that can be analysed. 

# Dependencies `src/dependencies`

This subfolder contains examples of weird and non-weird dependencies and connections between class files.

In the top of all files there is an annotation which starts 
with `->`, which indicates the known dependencies of the files.

```
// -> dtu.compute.Example
// -> dtu.compute.Other
```

Means that the file depends on Example and Other.

Pull requests are welcome to add more interesting corner cases.
